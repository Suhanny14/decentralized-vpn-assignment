# Task 3: Smart Contract Development & Local Deployment 🔗

**Points:** 50

## Overview
In this task, you'll learn the fundamentals of blockchain development by creating and deploying a simple "Hello VPN" smart contract locally. This will help you understand how blockchain works and how to deploy contracts - essential skills for our decentralized VPN project later.

---

## Part A: Development Environment Setup
**Points:** 8  
**Tools:** Node.js, Hardhat, MetaMask

### What to do:
1. **Install required software:**
   - Node.js (v16 or higher) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - A code editor (VS Code recommended)
   - MetaMask browser extension from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/)

2. **Set up your Hardhat project:**
```bash
mkdir hello-vpn-contract
cd hello-vpn-contract
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat init
```

3. Choose "Create a JavaScript project" when prompted

### Answer these in `setup-documentation.md`:

**1. Environment Configuration**
- Screenshot of successful Hardhat installation
- List all dependencies installed (from `package.json`)
- Screenshot of your project folder structure
- What is Hardhat and why do we use it for smart contract development?

**2. Understanding the Setup**
- What files were automatically generated by Hardhat?
- Explain the purpose of these folders:
  - `contracts/` folder
  - `scripts/` folder
  - `test/` folder
- What is `hardhat.config.js` used for?

## Part B: Smart Contract Development
**Points:** 12  
**Tools:** Solidity, Hardhat

### What to do:
1. Delete the default `Lock.sol` contract
2. Create a new file: `contracts/HelloVPN.sol`
3. Implement a **simple contract** with these features:

**Required Contract Functions:**
- `setGreeting(string memory _greeting)` - Store a greeting message
- `getGreeting()` - Returns the current greeting
- `setNodeCount(uint256 _count)` - Store a number representing VPN nodes
- `getNodeCount()` - Returns the node count
- `getDeployerAddress()` - Returns who deployed the contract

**Contract should store:**
- A greeting message (string)
- A node count (uint256)
- The deployer's address

### Answer these in `contract-development.md`:

**1. Your Contract Code**
- Paste your complete `HelloVPN.sol` contract code
- Add comments explaining what each function does

**2. Solidity Basics**
- What is a `constructor` and when does it run?
- Explain these keywords in your own words:
  - `public`
  - `private`
  - `view`
  - `memory`
- What is `msg.sender` and what information does it give you?
- Why do we declare variable types like `string` and `uint256`?

**3. Understanding State**
- What is a "state variable" in a smart contract?
- Where are state variables stored?
- What happens to state variables when you restart your computer?
- Take a screenshot showing your state variable declarations

---

## Part C: Testing Your Contract
**Points:** 8  
**Tools:** Hardhat, Chai (testing library)

### What to do:
1. Create `test/HelloVPN.test.js`
2. Write **3 simple tests**:
   - Test 1: Deploy contract and check initial values
   - Test 2: Update greeting and verify it changed
   - Test 3: Set node count and retrieve it

3. Run tests: `npx hardhat test`

### Answer these in `testing-documentation.md`:

**1. Test Results**
- Screenshot of all tests passing (showing green checkmarks)
- Paste your complete test code

**2. Basic Understanding**
- Why do we test smart contracts before deploying?
- What does this line do: `expect(greeting).to.equal("Hello VPN")`
- Screenshot showing the gas used in test output
- What is "gas" in simple terms?

---

## Part D: Local Deployment & Interaction
**Points:** 14  
**Tools:** Hardhat Local Network, MetaMask

### What to do:

**Step 1: Start Local Blockchain**
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
⚠️ Leave this terminal running!

**Step 2: Deploy Contract**

Create `scripts/deploy.js` that:
- Deploys HelloVPN contract
- Sets an initial greeting
- Prints the contract address
- Prints the deployer address

Run deployment:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

**Step 3: Configure MetaMask**

Add Hardhat Local Network to MetaMask:
- Network Name: `Hardhat Local`
- RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545/`
- Chain ID: `31337`
- Currency Symbol: `ETH`

Import Account #0 from Hardhat node (copy private key from terminal)

**Step 4: Interact with Contract**

Create `scripts/interact.js` that:
- Connects to the deployed contract
- Reads current greeting
- Updates greeting to "Welcome to Decentralized VPN!"
- Updates node count to 10
- Reads and displays all values

### Answer these in `deployment-documentation.md`:

**1. Deployment Process**
- Paste your `deploy.js` script with comments
- Screenshot of successful deployment (showing contract address)
- Screenshot of Hardhat node terminal showing the transaction
- What is a contract address? Why does it look like `0x5FbDB2...`?

**2. Understanding Deployment**
- How much gas was used? (check terminal)
- What is "gas" in blockchain terms?
- Can you deploy the same contract twice? What happens?

**3. MetaMask Setup**
- Screenshot of MetaMask showing:
  - Connected to Hardhat Local network
  - Account balance (should be ~10000 ETH)
- Why do test accounts have so much ETH?
- What happens to this ETH if you restart the Hardhat node?

**4. Contract Interaction**
- Paste your `interact.js` script
- Screenshot of script output showing:
  - Reading greeting
  - Updating greeting
  - Reading new greeting
  - Node count operations
- Screenshot of Hardhat node showing these transactions

**5. Transaction Deep Dive**

Pick ONE transaction from your Hardhat node terminal and explain:
- `from` address - whose address is this?
- `to` address - what is this address?
- `gasUsed` - what does this number mean?
- Screenshot highlighting these fields

---

## Part E: Understanding Blockchain Basics
**Points:** 8

### Answer these in `blockchain-concepts.md`:

**1. Local vs Real Blockchain**
- What are 3 differences between Hardhat local network and Ethereum mainnet?
- Why do we develop locally first?
- What would change if you deployed this same contract to real Ethereum?

**2. Smart Contract Basics**
- In your own words, what is a smart contract?
- Once deployed, can you edit the contract code? Why or why not?
- If you restart your Hardhat node, what happens to your deployed contract?
- How is a smart contract different from a regular program/website?

**3. Blockchain & Our VPN Project**
- Why would a VPN project use blockchain?
- What advantages does blockchain provide over a central database?
- What disadvantages or challenges might blockchain add?
- Give 2 examples of what our VPN project might store on blockchain

**4. Key Terms (Define in your own words)**
- Blockchain
- Smart Contract
- Gas
- Wallet Address
- Private Key
- Transaction
- Deployment

## Part F: Experimentation (Optional)
**Bonus Points:** +5

Try these experiments and document what happens:

### 1. Breaking Things (Safely!)
- What happens if you try to set an empty greeting `""`?
- What happens if you set a very long greeting (1000 characters)?
- Try calling `getGreeting()` before setting any greeting

### 2. Gas Experiments
- Deploy the contract and note gas used
- Update greeting with "Hi" - note gas used
- Update greeting with a 100 character string - note gas used
- Which operation uses more gas? Why?

### 3. Multiple Accounts
- Import a second account from Hardhat node into MetaMask
- Switch to this account
- Try to interact with the contract
- Does it work? What's different?

Document findings in `experiments.md`
